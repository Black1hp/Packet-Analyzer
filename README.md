## 📋 Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.8 or higher
- 📦 Node.js 14.x or higher
- 🛡️ Suricata 6.0 or higher
- 💻 Linux/Unix-based system (recommended)
- 🔄 Git

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-traffic-analyzer.git
cd network-traffic-analyzer
```

2. Set up the backend:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the frontend:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

4. Configure Suricata:
- Install Suricata if not already installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install suricata
```

- Copy and customize the Suricata configuration:
```bash
# Backup existing configuration
sudo cp /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml.bak

# Copy our template
sudo cp backend/suricata-config.yaml /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
```

- Edit the configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
```

Important configurations to check/modify:
- Replace `eth0` with your network interface name
- Adjust memory settings based on your system
- Verify the log paths:
  - EVE log: `/var/log/suricata/eve.json`
  - Main log: `/var/log/suricata/suricata.log`
- Configure the protocols you want to monitor
- Adjust threading based on your CPU

You can find a detailed configuration template in `backend/suricata-config.yaml` with comments explaining each section.

5. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cd ../backend
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit the .env file with your configuration:
```
SMTP_SERVER=your_smtp_server
SMTP_PORT=587
SENDER_EMAIL=your_email
SENDER_PASSWORD=your_password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin_email
ALERT_COOLDOWN_MINUTES=5
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Start Suricata:
```bash
# Test the configuration
sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

# Start Suricata
sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i <your-network-interface>
```

2. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
python server.py
```

3. Start the Suricata integration:
```bash
python suricata_integration.py --log-path /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

4. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

5. Access the web interface:
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## ❗ Troubleshooting

1. If Suricata fails to start:
   - 🔍 Check if the network interface is correct in suricata.yaml
   - 📝 Run `sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` to test configuration
   - 🔑 Check system permissions for log directories
   - 💾 Verify memory settings match your system capabilities
   - 🌐 Ensure the network interface supports monitoring mode

2. If the backend server fails:
   - ✅ Verify Python virtual environment is activated
   - 📦 Check all dependencies are installed
   - 🔌 Verify port 5000 is available
   - 📁 Check if Suricata logs exist and are readable

3. If the frontend fails to connect:
   - 🔄 Check if backend server is running
   - 🌐 Verify WebSocket connection
   - 🔍 Check browser console for errors
   - 📊 Verify data is being written to eve.json
